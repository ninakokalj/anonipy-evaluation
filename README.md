This project contains scripts for testing and evaluating different models relating to the `anonipy` package, including data anonymization and entity replacement.

## ‚òëÔ∏è Requirements

Before starting the project make sure these requirements are available:

- [python]. For setting up the environment and Python dependencies (version 3.9 or higher).
- [git]. For versioning your code.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### Create a python environment

First, create a virtual environment where all the modules will be stored.

#### Using venv

Using the `venv` command, run the following commands:

```bash
# create a new virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# activate the environment (UNIX)
source ./venv/bin/activate

# activate the environment (WINDOWS)
./venv/Scripts/activate

# deactivate the environment (UNIX & WINDOWS)
deactivate
```
